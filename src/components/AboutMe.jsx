        > I received my diploma in hardware and networking from Addis Ababa Tegbareid Polytechnic College. 
        During my studies, I installed and designed network structures, maintained computers, and troubleshooted issues.
         and for creating an entrance security system with my team, I received a gold medal. 
         I began my studies at Addis Abeba University after graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science.
          and I have been employed as an IT officer for Droga Pharma for the past 1.5 years.
          I can troubleshoot any computer issues and solve problems. Blender 3D animation, Adobe After Effects, 
        Adobe Premier Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and other editing software are some of my other skills.
         and I can program a little bit.</p>
