          I received my diploma in hardware and networking from Addis Ababa
          Tegbareid Polytechnic College. During my studies, I installed and
          designed network structures, maintained computers, and troubleshooted
          issues. and for creating an entrance security system with my team, I
          received a gold medal. I began my studies at Addis Abeba University
          after graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. and I
          have been employed as an IT officer for Droga Pharma for the past 1.5
          years. I can troubleshoot any computer issues and solve problems.
          Blender 3D animation, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premier Pro, Adobe
          Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and other editing software are some of
          my other skills. and I can program a little bit.
